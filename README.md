Overview
-----
From [Data to Viz.com](https://www.data-to-viz.com) is a website aiming to help in your chart decision. It classifies most of the chart types based on their input data format. It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent your dataset.


<br>

Sections
-----
The project is composed by several sections:

- *[Decision Tree]()* - leads you from your data format to a set of potential graphics.
- *[Data story](https://www.data-to-viz.com/#story)* - for each data format, an example of data analysis based on real data is performed.
- *[All graphics](https://www.data-to-viz.com/#portfolio)* - an overview of all graphics presented in the website. A set of explanation and advices is provided for each.
- *[Caveats](https://www.data-to-viz.com/#caveats)* - a gallery of comon caveats in dataviz, with explanation and workarounds.
