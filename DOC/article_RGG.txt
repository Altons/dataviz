From Data to Viz
=================

I’m delighted to announce a new dataviz project called ‘Data to Viz’.

www.data-to-viz.com

- What it is
It is a classification of chart types based on input data format. It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent the dataset.

- Philosophie
The project is built on two underlying philosophies. First, that most data analysis can be summarized in about twenty different dataset formats. Second, that both data and context determine the appropriate chart.

Thus, our suggested method consists in identifying and trying all feasible chart types to find out which suits your data and idea best.

Once this set of graphic identified, data-to-viz.com aims to guide you toward the best decision.



- Content
Several section are available on top of the decision tree:
- an overview of all chart possibilities
- a set of stories
- a gallery of common caveats to avoid, and always provide the reproducible code snippet in the R programming language.


- Creation
Mostly Restat, tidy verse, Rmakrdown, pimp my RMD



Dataviz is a world with endless possibilities and this project does not claim to be exhaustive. However it should provide you with a good starting point.
