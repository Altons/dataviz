# Definition {#definition}

An histogram is an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of a numeric variable. It takes as input one numerical variable only. The variable is cut into several bins, and the number of observation per bin is represented by the height of the bar.  

Here is an example showing the distribution of the night price of Rbnb appartements in the south of France. Price range is divided per 10 euros interval. For example, there are slightly less than 750 appartements with a night price between 100 and 110 euros:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)

# Load dataset from github
data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/1_OneNum.csv", header=TRUE)

# Make the histogram
data %>%
  filter( price<300 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=price)) +
    stat_bin(breaks=seq(0,300,10), fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    ggtitle("Night price distribution of Airbnb appartements") +
    theme_ipsum()
```




# Common mistakes {#mistake}
***

- [Try several bin size](), it can lead to very different conclusions.
- Don't use weird color sheme. It does not give any more insight.
- Don't confound it with a [barplot](). A barplot gives a value for each group of a categoric variable. Here, we have only a numeric variable and we chack its distribution.
- [Don't compare more than ~3 groups]() in the same histogram. The graphic gets cluttered and hardly understandable. Instead use a violin plot, a boxplot, a ridgeline plot or use small multiple.
