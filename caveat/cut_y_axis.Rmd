Cuting or not the Y axis is probably one of the most disputed topic in data visualization, as [here](http://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html), [here](https://qz.com/418083/its-ok-not-to-start-your-y-axis-at-zero/) and [here](http://stephanieevergreen.com/y-axis/). Basically, the idea is to decide wether or not the Y axis should always start at zero or not. Let's try to find out why this topic struggles to get a consensus.

Let's start with a barplot showing the

By its design bar graph emphasizes the absolute magnitude of values associated with each category, whereas a line graph emphasizes the change in the dependent variable (usually the y value) as the independent variable (usually the x value) changes.

- Barplot: In this kind there is a consensus: your Y axis should starts at 0
- Line plot: Here however there is no consensus, even if in general you don't have to start at 0.
