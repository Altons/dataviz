`Colors` are one of the main mediums used to convey information in dataviz. They allow to highlight groups or variation when used appropriately, but are confusing or misleading otherwise.

Here is an example showing the quantity of weapons exported by the top 20 largest exporters in 2017 (more info [here](http://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumOneCat.html)):

Here, each country is represented using a random color. When looking at it, your audience may try to understand what the color means. They are thus `less focused` on the main point: the bar length.


WHY

obfuscates the plot, making it more difficult to find the percentages by eye.


# 3D in 2d
***
That's quite bad in my opinion
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10}
library(scatterplot3d)
attach(mtcars)
scatterplot3d(wt,disp,mpg, main="3D Scatterplot")
```



# Good 3d

Note that you can use color to highlight the variation presented by the bar length. I'm personally not a big fan of it, but it is a common practice;
```{r rgl-firstexample, webgl=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rgl)
library(knitr)
knit_hooks$set(webgl = hook_webgl)

z=iris
#colors vector
x=rep(0,150)

for (i in 1:150) {
	if(z$Species[i] == 'setosa') {x[i]='royalblue1'}
	if(z$Species[i] == 'versicolor') {x[i]='darkcyan'}
	if(z$Species[i] == 'virginica') {x[i]='oldlace'}
}
z$Color=x

plot3d( z[,1], z[,2], z[,3], col = z$Color, type = 's', radius = .1 )
```




#Conclusion
***
When adding color to your chart, always double check it adds insight to it. Usually colors are useful to:

- Show groups
- Highlight an item
- Show gradient
